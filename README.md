# tasks

this is a task project that I have made using php,css, and mySQL from phpmyAdmin, in order to solidify my understanding from my university class of php and using databases to manipulate my code and to save data like done in the real world. Unfortunatley to my understanding I am not able to host the website itself on github due to the database and due to me needing an "index.html", but if later I decide to make my own host for this website I will update this readme and just put the link.
